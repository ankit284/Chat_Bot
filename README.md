# Chat_Bot

# Features Set

* The bot should be able to identify common synonyms of city names, such as Bangalore/Bengaluru, Mumbai/Bombay etc.

* Your chatbot should provide results for tier-1 and tier-2 cities only, while for tier-3 cities, it should reply back with something like "We do not operate in that area yet".

* Cuisine Preference: Take the cuisine preference from the customer. The bot should list out the following six cuisine categories (Chinese, Mexican, Italian, American, South Indian & North Indian) and the customer can select any one out of that. Following is an example for the same:

* Average budget for two people: Segment the price range (average budget for two people) into three price categories: lesser than 300, 300 to 700 and more than 700. The bot should ask the user to select one of the three price categories.

* The bot should display the top 5 restaurants in a sorted order (descending) of the average Zomato user rating (on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest). The format should be: {restaurant_name} in {restaurant_address} has been rated {rating}.

* Finally, the bot should ask the user whether he/she wants the details of the top 10 restaurants on email. If the user replies 'yes', the bot should ask for userâ€™s email id and then send it over email. Else, just reply with a 'goodbye' message. The mail should have the following details for each restaurant:

    - Restaurant Name
    - Restaurant locality address
    - Average budget for two people
    - Zomato user rating
